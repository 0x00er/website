**Welcome to your one-stop shop for all things cyberpunk!** Cyberpunk began as a subgenre of science fiction that's "high tech and low life." The genre generally focuses on the conflict between hackers and corrupt governments and megacorporations, in a dystopian near-future setting. Subtexts of the genre, like in William Gibson's prophetic novel Neuromancer, often deal with the social (and occasionally economic) impacts of new technology like cybernetics.

Originally gaining popularity in the late 20th century, cyberpunk has stood the test of time, as our present-day world starts to move more and more in the direction of the fictional worlds in the aforementioned Neuromancer and Ridley Scott's near-prophetic film Blade Runner.

Soon after its popularity rose, Cyberpunk became a designator for the freelance computer hacker, independent of the literary genre. The author who invented this term was surprised when this occurred. Cyberpunks in this sense are fundamentally a culture of hackers whom use their technological process to augment themselves, and "fite da machine".

This page offers the essentials of cyberpunk, what the genre means, and briefly gives guides on how to utilize the cyberpunk lifestyle.

Everyday, we are proving more and more to be in a cyberpunk dystopia.
