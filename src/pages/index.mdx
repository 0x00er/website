	I'm currently studying physics and computer science at [IILM University](https://iilm.edu/). Outside of academia, I'm an active member of [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/), and a full-stack developer. Passionate about [FOSS](https://www.tukutoi.com/the-paradox-of-open-source-the-power-of-collaboration-in-the-foss-community/) and I regularly compete in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, sharpening my skills as a digital mercenary.


	## Computers!

	Since I was 9 years old, I have had a fervent love for computers and technology, limited only by realities of economics and time.

	I spend countless hours in the digital realm, writing code and crafting with tech. My obsession with building has led to a collection of side projects, You can [explore a curated list of stuff I've done](#projects) if you're interested.

	I use Rust, Python, and a suite of hacker tools like Metasploit, Nmap, and Wireshark daily. My primary OS is Fedora for everyday use, while my specialized rig for cyber ops runs a custom setup (you can [ check out my dotfiles](https://github.com/0x00er/dotfiles); they're pretty slick).
	
	I'm often asked, 'hey Sagar, what kind of programming do you do?' and truth be told, I'm into a bit of everything: Delving into systems! Embedded hardware! Cracking codes! Gadgets! Apps & Compilers! I find it immensely enjoyable to learn how shit works and go down rabbit holes, and I learn whatever it takes to create what I'm excited about.

	Since joining IILM University, I've been diving into cool projects with some awesome people like [stepping into the Matrix](https://adriandeleon2905.medium.com/stepping-into-the-matrix-47d49be76cd3), and it's been pretty amazing. When I'm not developing tools or eating too much ice cream, Iâ€™m into photometry, philosophy, and zine writing.

	A CPU I crafted during my school days, embodying simplicity reminiscent of 8-bit architectures:
	<img src='/photos/cpu.png' alt='Simple 8-bit CPU I designed. Top right is program memory with machine code i created. Bottom right is memory in which program stores prime numbers up to 255' width='80%' height='0' loading='lazy' style='width: min(1020px, 100%);' />

<h2 id="astronomy">Astronomy & Cyberpunk!</h2>

	I'm a amateur astronomer. I've always been hooked on the stars and the cosmic abyss, constantly sparking my cyberpunk exploits amidst the celestial spectacles.

	Iâ€™m currently diving into astronomy and photometry, uncovering cosmic secrets and mastering light measurement. I'm also deeply immersed in cyberpunk culture, crafting [zines](https://wiki.installgentoo.com/wiki/Zine) that explore dystopian worlds and rebellious narratives. Each story is a neon-lit adventure, pushing the boundaries of imagination.

	## Music!

	When I'm not programming, staring at the stars, or slacking off, I'm probably doing something hip-hop related.
	I spend a lot of my time listening to music. <span id='song'>In fact, I'm probably jamming to something right now!</span> My tastes span a variety of genres, but I especially love upbeat songs, hip-hop, rock, and electronic music. I used to play Rocksmith, though I havenâ€™t had much time for it lately.

	Here are my favorite albums, in no particular order:

	- [To Pimp a Butterfly](https://open.spotify.com/album/7ycBtnsMtyVbbwTfJwRjSP?si=nFagmSMPTdeFftZO7x1uGA) (jazz, funk, and soul)
	- [Sacred Ground](https://open.spotify.com/album/18N57Dml4yz9hVjzr4mV5S?si=Rx0vvGCYRaeN-RCjnI_sPA) (folk-pop bliss)
	- [The Uncanny Valley](https://soundcloud.com/perturbator/sets/perturbator-the-uncanny-valley) (bought a patch for my jacket from Blood Music )
	- [æ”»æ®»æ©Ÿå‹•éšŠ STAND ALONE COMPLEX O.S.T.ï¼‹](https://open.spotify.com/album/2xwzJG5kuUOIuyEf6u3OXQ?si=D1agO5acRQCoC8Hl38sN6g&nd=1&dlsi=233a72f51d4240de) (!!!!!!!)
	- [For Ever](https://open.spotify.com/album/5gYCZgmXzzWXxOCb9fMfBm?si=0kgiVvwWSgm_fV8KQY56LQ) (funk music?)
	- [Wallsocket by underscores](https://album.link/us/i/1693478262) (amazing rock-hyperpop-edm blend)

	I've also been vibing to some classic rock and punk from the '80s and '90s. Here's a [Spotify playlist (Lithium)](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2B5LExQ2dkmvF2jtcBtuZi?si=f5c29b5904624c0d) I made, love it or hate it.

	## Other things!

	Iâ€™ve been getting into mirror making so I can build my own telescope. Itâ€™s a tough but satisfying hobby. Iâ€™m also learning Astropy and writing astronomy programs, exploring the universe one line of code at a time. I also enjoy tinkering with old hardware.

	Books are a big part of my life, but I also love watching cool movies. Many of my favorite films are anime-style, especially classics like [Ghost in the Shell](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113568/) and [Cowboy Bebop](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213338/). When it comes to live-action films that have left a lasting impression on me are [Metropolis](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0017136/), [Maborosi](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113725/), [Arrival](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/), and [Birdman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2562232/). And, of course, the groundbreaking storytelling of The [Matrix](https://matrix.fandom.com/wiki/The_Matrix_franchise) trilogy holds a special place in my heart.

	## Projects!

	Now In the shadows of cyberspace, I'm currently involved in a few projects that are still under wraps. While they may not be ready for the spotlight just yet, rest assured that I'm diligently working behind the scenes.

	Here's a semi-complete and unordered list of tech projects I've dabbled in over the years. Links are included for the ones that might pique your interest:

	- **[CrackDash](https://github.com/0x00er/CrackDash):** A lightweight tool for blazing-fast ZIP and RAR password cracking using password list! 
	- **[tkinter-timer](https://github.com/0x00er/tkinter-timer):** Python GUI to show conference or meeting timer items with a time remaining countdown.

	## About this site
	This website is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/) with a heavily modified version of the cyberpunk retro web aesthetic.

	I tend to get bored quickly, so this website or online identity could 
disappear without any warning (but I will try not to). I might also be a
 little bit paranoid (my bad).
